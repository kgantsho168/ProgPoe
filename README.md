# ProgPoe
# Part2
To be able to compile or run the Program a Visual Studio ide that accepts a C# console is required
To run compile and run software:
Step 1: Open ProgPoe.zip Folder
Step 2: Open ProgPoe File folder
Step 3: Select and Open the 'ProgPoe.snl project file

By using the feedback and re-doing the part one I discovered possible potential errors and variables I needed to change in order to continue with the project, by using generic collection, it gave me an easier and better way of storing ingredients, unit of measurements, quantity ...etc, instead of using multi-dimensional arrays that required a lot complex codes and a lot of loops. I was able to add new features that only require me to insert less but well thought of code, I used manipulation in order to be able to create other features that require user input and calculations from that software.
