I had minor errors that caused problems with certain functions, there were infinite loops in the previous program for part 2, I corrected the errors by using break functions to exit the loop functions in order to start new functions that were following after the function that would cause a forever loop of requiring user input or errors in the program. I havenâ€™t changed  most of the program as some were working and not resulting in errors, I added new functions that resulted in changing some of the previous functions in order for the new functions to work without any minor or major error that can affect the whole application.
